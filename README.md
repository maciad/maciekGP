# Genetic Programming System

Welcome to the Genetic Programming (GP) System project repository! Here you can find my implementation of a Genetic Programming system capable of creating, executing, evaluating and evolving programs written in [my own programming language](https://github.com/maciad/maciekGP/blob/master/grammar/maciekGP.g4).

## Overview

The Genetic Programming (GP) System is a technique used in the field of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing. It utilizes mechanisms inspired by biological evolution to generate computer programs that solve specific problems. Programs generated by the system must be represented in a form that can be evaluated and manipulated during the evolution process. Therefore, I have decided to use a data structure known as a tree. 

The system begins with the initialization of a population, creating an initial set of programs that will undergo the evolution process. This initial population consists of randomly generated, very simple programs, which often lack sense. The only constraint is compliance with the grammar used in the project. The next step is the evaluation of individuals based on a fitness function defined for a specific problem. Programs that achieve the best results are selected for reproduction and the creation of the next generation. Individuals entering the new generation are obtained in one of two ways: mutation or crossover. Mutation involves randomly changing a small fragment of a given program. Mutations can aid in exploring solution spaces, allowing for the discovery of potentially better programs. Crossover reflects the process of genetic recombination in biological evolution. It is a process of 'merging' two individuals from the previous generation by exchanging corresponding code fragments between them. Individuals undergoing crossover are selected based on tournament selection of a specified size (the default size in the system is 5). Tournament selection of size n involves selecting the individual that best adapts to the given problem, achieving the best fitness value among n candidates. The process of selection, crossover, and mutation is repeated for many generations until a satisfactory solution to the problem is obtained or until a predefined iteration limit is reached.

After the evolution of programs is completed, the final population is evaluated, and the best solution is selected as the result. It may happen that during evolution, the system gets stuck in a local minimum due to various reasons, and the generated solution stops evolving. A solution to this may be to restart the system one or several times.
